       <p>What it takes to run online grocery store successfully- Powerful Website Features.
        Grocery stores have wide array of products and to offer users the ease of buying,
         the new stores should make the products easily accessible.
          In short, make the website as simple as a physical grocery store.
           Since several online grocery stores have emerged globally in recent times,
            they act as inspiration to new stores, and this is true particularly for emerging markets.
             In the wake of attempts made to build a clone of top brands, new websites ignore 
             the importance of few website features that have serious upshots.
              With many stores in view, it has turned into a great difficulty for new businesses to make a grocery shopping website
               as good as the successful grocery stores without killing user experience. 
               To name a few ShopFoodEx.com, FreshDirect, InstaCart, are the dream stores of websites like MeraGrocer,
                Grofers, BigBasket, Natures Basket, but receiving a good response from end customers depends on many factors.</p>
